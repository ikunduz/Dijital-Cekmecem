    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the Dijital Çekmecem app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by ikunduz as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p> <br><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong> <p>
      The Application captures generic usage data via Google Mobile Ads SDK for advertising purposes. It also accesses your device's Camera and Storage to allow you to upload and manage your home documents locally. All personal data such as receipts and documents are stored locally on your device or your personal iCloud/Google Drive if you choose to back them up. We do not store your personal documents on our servers.
    </p> <br><strong>Security</strong> <p>
      We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain.
    </p> <br><strong>Contact Us</strong> <p>
      If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via GitHub issues.
